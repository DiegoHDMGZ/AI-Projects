#Introduction

This is a machine learning application that can be used to detect cough events from videos and print the cough frequency (cough/minutes). Two classification algorithms 
were analyzed : Support Vector Machine and Neural Networks.

We achieved 54.54% accuracy using SVM and 81.32% accuracy using Neural Networks.
